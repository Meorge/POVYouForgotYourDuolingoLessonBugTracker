# *POV You Forgot Your Duolingo Lesson* Bug Tracker
This is a little bug-tracking repository for the game [*POV You Forgot Your Duolingo Lesson*](https://meorge.itch.io/pov-you-forgot-your-duolingo-lesson). If you run into any bugs, please submit an issue with:
- The platform you were running the game on (Windows or macOS)
- What you were doing in the game when the bug happened (if you can provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce it that would be best!)
- Any screenshots or video clips of the bug
- The `Player.log` file
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Meorge/POV You Forgot Your Duolingo Lesson/Player.log`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Meorge\POVYouForgotYourDuolingoLesson\Player.log`

**Note:** There's no promise that bugs posted here will eventually be fixed. With a lot of stuff going on in my life right now, most importantly [a major car accident](https://meorge.itch.io/pov-you-forgot-your-duolingo-lesson/devlog/518648/car-accident-aka-why-there-havent-been-updates), I'm not super motivated to work more on the game right now. In the future, when I have more energy, I might return to this bug tracker and try to fix some of the bugs. Thanks for understanding!
